# Honeypot-AWS

A honeypot is a security mechanism used in cybersecurity to detect, deflect, or counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. It typically consists of a computer, data, or network site that appears to be part of a legitimate network but is actually isolated and monitored, with the intention of attracting and observing malicious activity. The term "honeypot" comes from the idea of a pot of honey used to attract and catch bears. Similarly, in the digital realm, a honeypot is designed to lure attackers and malware, allowing security professionals to study their tactics, understand their methods, and gather information to better protect the real systems from such threats. Honeypots can be valuable tools for studying the behavior of hackers and developing strategies to defend against them.
